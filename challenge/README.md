## 🧐 Background

*Fix my code* is a special Holberton School project where you **fix, not rewrite**!  
You’ll work with code in Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and C, finding and correcting bugs while preserving the original logic.

- **No need to recode everything**: Only fix what’s broken!
- **Not mandatory**: This project is 100% optional and can only boost your grade.
- **Have fun**: See how well you can debug code in different languages!

## 🏆 Tasks

### 0. FizzBuzz (Python)
> Fix the classic FizzBuzz so that 15 prints "FizzBuzz" (not just "Fizz").

### 1. Print Square (JavaScript)
> Ensure the script prints a perfect square of the requested size.

### 2. Sort (Ruby)
> Make sure arguments are sorted correctly, both numerically and alphabetically.

### 3. User Password (Python)
> Correct the password validation logic so all tests pass without errors.

### 4. Double Linked List (C)
> Debug the linked list implementation so all operations work as expected.
